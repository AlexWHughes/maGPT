ChatGPT prompts to convert a useful console into MA3 garbage. 
This is a salty direct rip off of a very useful ChatGPT prompt for Cuepoints https://github.com/mithxyz/CueGPT
#  How do I actually use it?

How do you use it? Great question. Click on the following link to view the raw text and without reading it copy and paste it into a ChatGPT window. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexWHughes/maGPT/main/CuePrompt
I mean you can read it, but that ruins the jokes doesn't it. 


And yes, I'll consider merge requests. 
# üìù Credits
